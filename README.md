# JavaIterasys
This is a project to study Selenium with Java and other features.

This repository has some simple tests to understand the basic functionality of Rest Assured, TestNG, Selenium, Cucumber and Gherkin.

All projects in this repository are based on Iterasys classes, so all data used in this project is not real.

I'm using IntteliJ IDEA to create all the tests. I'll keep this repository updated until I finish all classes.
